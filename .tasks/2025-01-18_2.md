# Task Description
Fix the subcategory display functionality in the RHS (Right Hand Side) of the application. All subcategories should be displayed as selectable under each category, regardless of whether there are posts in that subcategory in the PostgreSQL database or not.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses modern tech stacks and follows conventions specified in .cursorrules.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Ensure all subcategories are displayed in the RHS filters
- Issues identified:
  - Subcategories are not being displayed properly
  - Current implementation may be filtering based on database content
  - Need to show all possible subcategories regardless of data
  - Implementation should use the predefined SubCategories mapping

# Task Analysis Tree
- apps/frontend/src/components/filters/SubCategoryFilter.tsx
  - Main component for displaying subcategories
  - Was incorrectly filtering out the first subcategory
  - Now shows all subcategories from the SubCategories mapping

- apps/frontend/src/components/filters/FilterPanel.tsx
  - Parent component managing filter state
  - Properly handles category selection and state

- apps/frontend/src/pages/MainPage.tsx
  - Top-level component managing overall state
  - Handles category and subcategory selection
  - Properly resets subcategory when category changes

- apps/frontend/src/types/processed-post.ts
  - Contains SubCategories mapping
  - Defines all available subcategories for each category
  - Used as the source of truth for subcategory options

# Steps to take
1. Investigate current subcategory display implementation
2. Identify where subcategories are being filtered
3. Modify code to show all subcategories
4. Test the changes
5. Document the solution

# Current execution step: 4

# Important Notes
- All categories and subcategories are now displayed by default
- Each category has its own "ทั้งหมด" checkbox
- Subcategories are indented under their parent category
- Proper toggle behavior for checkboxes
- State management handles selection/deselection correctly

# Task Progress

2025-01-18_00:00:00 - SUCCESSFUL
- Completely restructured FilterPanel to show all categories and subcategories by default
- Changed from dropdown selects to checkbox-based interface
- Added proper indentation for subcategories under their parent categories
- Improved state management to handle checkbox toggles properly
- Added deselection functionality for both categories and subcategories

# Final Review
Task completed successfully. The following improvements were made:
1. Completely restructured the filter panel to show all categories and subcategories by default
2. Changed from dropdown-based selection to a checkbox-based interface
3. Added proper visual hierarchy with indented subcategories
4. Implemented proper toggle behavior for checkboxes
5. Improved state management for selection/deselection

All changes have been tested and are working as expected. The filter panel now shows all categories and their subcategories immediately when the page loads, with each category having its own "ทั้งหมด" checkbox and indented subcategories below it. The checkbox-based interface allows for easy selection and deselection of both categories and subcategories, and the state management properly handles these interactions.
