# Task Description
Implement a comprehensive location data population system for Thailand's administrative regions:
1. Create a script to fetch and process location data from official sources
2. Implement the database schema and population logic
3. Set up the verification process for coordinates

Key requirements:
- Support multiple data sources (GISTDA, Thailand Post, OpenStreetMap)
- Implement hierarchical data structure (Province -> Amphure -> Tumbon)
- Include coordinate validation and verification
- Support both Thai and English names
- Track data sources and verification status

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database.

# Task Analysis
## Purpose
- Create a reliable and comprehensive location data system for Thailand
- Ensure accurate coordinate data for mapping water-related incidents
- Support fallback mechanisms for location resolution
- Enable efficient location-based queries and updates

## Issues Identified
Problems:
- Incomplete coordinate data for administrative regions
- Inconsistent coordinate sources and accuracy
- Missing verification system for coordinates
- No standardized update process

Why it needs resolution:
- Critical for accurate incident mapping
- Essential for location-based analytics
- Required for reliable geographic clustering
- Necessary for proper incident response coordination

Implementation goals:
1. Create robust data fetching system
2. Implement comprehensive database schema
3. Set up coordinate verification process
4. Establish data update protocols

# Steps to take
1. Create database schema for location data
2. Implement location service and models
3. Create coordinate validation utilities
4. Develop data fetching scripts
5. Set up verification process
6. Implement update protocols

# Current execution step: 4 (Implementation)

# Important Notes
- Use TypeScript for all implementations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Include data source attribution
- Maintain data update history
- Ensure coordinate validation
- Support both Thai and English names
- Track verification status and source
