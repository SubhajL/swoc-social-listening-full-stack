# Task Description
Enhance database error handling and add startup permission checks:
1. Add more specific error handling for common database errors
2. Add a database permission check at startup to catch issues early

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses Next.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data storage. The system follows strict conventions and folder structures as specified in .cursorrules.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Improve error handling and early detection of database issues
- Issues identified:
  - Current error handling is too generic
  - Permission issues are only caught at runtime
  - Need to validate database access early
- Implementation goals:
  1. Add specific error handlers for common PostgreSQL error codes
  2. Implement startup checks for database permissions
  3. Improve error messages for better debugging

# Steps to take
1. Add specific error handlers for common PostgreSQL error codes
2. Create a database health check service
3. Implement startup permission validation
4. Add detailed logging for database errors
5. Update error messages to be more user-friendly

# Current execution step: 5

# Important Notes
- PostgreSQL error codes to handle:
  - 42501: Permission denied
  - 42P01: Undefined table
  - 42703: Undefined column
  - 28000: Invalid authorization specification
  - 3D000: Invalid catalog name
  - 08006: Connection failure
  - 23505: Unique violation
  - 23503: Foreign key violation
- Need to check permissions on critical tables at startup
- Should not expose internal database errors to clients
- Added graceful shutdown handling for database connections
