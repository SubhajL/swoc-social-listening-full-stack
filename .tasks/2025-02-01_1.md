# Task Description
Fix the following errors in the application:
1. React Router Future Flag Warnings:
   - `v7_startTransition` flag warning
   - `v7_relativeSplatPath` flag warning
2. API Error:
   - 500 Internal Server Error from `/api/posts/unprocessed` endpoint
   - Failed to load posts error in Map component

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Fix React Router warnings and API errors
- Issues identified:
  1. React Router v6 warnings about upcoming v7 changes
     - Need to add future flags for transition handling
     - Need to add future flags for splat route resolution
  2. Backend API error causing 500 response
     - Error in ProcessedPostService.getUnprocessedPosts()
     - Database query or connection issue
     - Error propagation to frontend Map component
- Implementation goals:
  - Add React Router future flags
  - Debug and fix backend API error
  - Improve error handling in frontend

# Task Analysis Tree
- Frontend:
  - apps/frontend/src/components/Map.tsx
    - Uses apiClient.getUnprocessedPosts()
    - Handles API errors but needs improvement
  - apps/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts
    - Implements API calls
    - Basic error handling present
- Backend:
  - apps/backend/src/api/posts/index.ts
    - Handles /api/posts/unprocessed route
    - Uses ProcessedPostService
  - apps/backend/src/services/processed-post.service.ts
    - Implements getUnprocessedPosts()
    - Uses database pool for queries
  - apps/backend/src/models/processed-post.ts
    - Defines ProcessedPost interface
  - apps/backend/src/types/processed-post.dto.ts
    - Defines DTO interfaces

# Steps to take
1. Add React Router future flags
   - Configure v7_startTransition
   - Configure v7_relativeSplatPath
2. Debug backend API error
   - Add detailed logging
   - Check database connection
   - Verify query execution
3. Improve error handling
   - Enhance frontend error messages
   - Add retry mechanism for failed requests
4. Fix TypeScript errors in Map component tests
   - Properly type Mapbox GL mocks
   - Implement correct mock structure
   - Add comprehensive test cases

  - Map initialization
  - Post filtering
  - Real-time updates
  - Error states
- Centralized mock setup
- Removed redundant code
- All tests passing

Current execution step: 4 (All steps completed)

# Final Review
The task has been completed successfully:
1. React Router warnings have been resolved by adding the necessary future flags in App.tsx
2. Backend API error has been fixed by:
   - Updating the ProcessedPostService to match the actual database schema
   - Removing status-related code that was causing errors
   - Updating DTO types to match the database structure
3. Error handling has been improved:
   - Added retry mechanism for failed API calls
   - Added loading states and better error UI
   - Enhanced user feedback with toast notifications
   - Updated types to match the database schema
4. Map component tests have been fixed:
   - Properly typed all mocks
   - Added comprehensive test coverage
   - Improved test maintainability
   - All TypeScript errors resolved
5. The application is now working correctly:
   - Backend server starts without errors
   - API endpoint returns posts successfully
   - Frontend displays posts without errors
   - React Router warnings are gone
   - Failed requests are retried automatically
   - Users get clear feedback about errors and loading states
   - Map component tests are passing and type-safe
