# Task Description
Implement clickable map icons for the latest 20 records from PostgreSQL, showing different shapes based on categories:
- Triangle, square, circle, and hexa icons for each category
- Show locations based on latitude/longitude or fallback to tumbon/amphure/province
- Link icons to ComplaintForm page with pre-filled data from database

Database fields mapping to ComplaintForm:
- ประเด็นข้อร้องเรียน <- text
- ประเภทข้อร้องเรียน <- category_name + sub1_category_name
- ข้อมูลผู้ร้องเรียน <- profile_name
- วันที่ <- post_date
- Link <- post_url
- พิกัด <- latitude
- ตำแหน่ง <- longitude
- ที่อยู่ <- tumbon + amphure + province

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand, focusing on water-related incidents. The platform uses Next.js, PostgreSQL, and modern UI frameworks following conventions specified in .cursorrules.

# Task Analysis
Purpose:
- Display latest water-related incidents on an interactive map
- Provide visual categorization through different icon shapes
- Enable quick access to detailed complaint information

Implementation Goals:
1. Query latest 20 records from PostgreSQL with location info
2. Render category-specific icons on map
3. Implement location fallback hierarchy
4. Set up ComplaintForm data pre-filling
5. Ensure smooth navigation and data transfer

# Steps to take
1. Create PostgreSQL query for latest 20 records
2. Implement map icon components for each category
3. Add location fallback logic
4. Set up navigation with state transfer
5. Test data flow and display

# Current execution step: 1

# Important Notes
- Ensure proper error handling for missing location data
- Implement smooth loading states for map icons
- Verify data type consistency between database and frontend
- Consider adding tooltips for map icons
- Test all location fallback scenarios
- Ready to merge branch 'task/map-icons_2025-01-21_2' into 'integration-post'
