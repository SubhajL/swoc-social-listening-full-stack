# Task Description
Fix geocoding errors in location data update script:
1. Fix Thai character encoding issues in Google Maps API queries
2. Improve error handling and logging
3. Optimize geocoding query construction for Thai addresses
4. Add data validation for coordinates returned from API

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The project uses Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend. The location data is crucial for mapping and analyzing water-related incidents across Thailand.

  - Insufficient error logging in geocoding failures
  - Query construction might need optimization
  - Need better validation of returned coordinates
- Implementation goals:
  1. Fix Thai character encoding
  2. Enhance error logging
  3. Optimize query construction

# Location Data Update Task

## Status: IN_PROGRESS
## Last Updated: 2025-01-25_14:55:00

## Current Findings

1. API Key Issue
   - The Google Maps API key is invalid or not properly configured
   - Direct API test returns "REQUEST_DENIED" with message: "You must use an API key to authenticate each request"
   - Need to obtain a new API key with the following services enabled:
     - Geocoding API
     - Places API
     - Maps JavaScript API

2. Character Encoding Issues
   - Thai characters in province names are not being encoded correctly
   - Example: `ศาลากลางจังหวัดà¸. à¸ªà¸à¸¹à¸¥` instead of proper Thai text
   - Need to fix the encoding in the query construction

## Next Steps

1. API Key Setup
   - Create a new Google Cloud Project
   - Enable required APIs (Geocoding, Places, Maps JavaScript)
   - Generate new API key with proper restrictions
   - Update .env file with new key

2. Character Encoding Fix
   - Review and update normalizeThaiText function
   - Ensure proper UTF-8 handling in query construction
   - Add tests for character encoding

## Important Notes
- All geocoding tests are currently failing due to invalid API key
- Thai text normalization is working for basic cases but fails with abbreviated formats
- Query construction formats are correct but character encoding needs fixing
