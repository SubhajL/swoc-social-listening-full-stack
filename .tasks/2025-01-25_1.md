# Task Description
Fix geocoding errors in location data update script:
1. Fix Thai character encoding issues in Google Maps API queries
2. Improve error handling and logging
3. Optimize geocoding query construction for Thai addresses
4. Add data validation for coordinates returned from API

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The project uses Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend. The location data is crucial for mapping and analyzing water-related incidents across Thailand.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Fix geocoding errors in location data update script
- Issues identified:
  - Thai character encoding corruption: `ศาลากลางจังหวัดà ̧. à ̧aà ̧à ̧1à ̧¥`
  - Insufficient error logging in geocoding failures
  - Query construction might need optimization
  - Need better validation of returned coordinates
- Implementation goals:
  1. Fix Thai character encoding
  2. Enhance error logging
  3. Optimize query construction
  4. Add coordinate validation

# Location Data Update Task

## Status: IN_PROGRESS
## Last Updated: 2025-01-25_14:55:00

## Recent Updates
- All geocoding tests are failing due to an invalid Google Maps API key
- Direct API test confirms REQUEST_DENIED status with error message "The provided API key is invalid"
- Thai text normalization and query construction are working correctly
- Coordinate validation logic is functioning as expected

## Current Issues
1. Google Maps API key (AIzaSyDZvxOFNDXcOFy_uXYBdYYn5UdRD4U6Xgw) is invalid
   - All API requests return REQUEST_DENIED status
   - Error message indicates the key needs to be replaced

## Next Steps
1. Obtain a new valid Google Maps API key
2. Update the API key in the environment configuration
3. Re-run tests with the new API key
4. Monitor results and verify successful geocoding

## Important Notes
- Query construction and Thai text handling are working correctly
- The issue is not with the code implementation but with API authentication
- Need to ensure the new API key has the Geocoding API enabled
- Consider implementing API key rotation or monitoring
