# Task Description
Fix geocoding errors in location data update script:
1. Fix Thai character encoding issues in Google Maps API queries
2. Improve error handling and logging
3. Optimize geocoding query construction for Thai addresses
4. Add data validation for coordinates returned from API

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The project uses Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend. The location data is crucial for mapping and analyzing water-related incidents across Thailand.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Fix geocoding errors in location data update script
- Issues identified:
  - Thai character encoding corruption: `ศาลากลางจังหวัดà ̧. à ̧aà ̧à ̧1à ̧¥`
  - Insufficient error logging in geocoding failures
  - Query construction might need optimization
  - Need better validation of returned coordinates
- Implementation goals:
  1. Fix Thai character encoding
  2. Enhance error logging
  3. Optimize query construction
  4. Add coordinate validation

# Steps to take
1. Fix Thai character encoding in query strings
2. Enhance error logging with detailed error information
3. Optimize query construction for Thai addresses
4. Add coordinate validation
5. Test fixes with sample data
6. Update documentation

# Current execution step: 1

# Important Notes
- Need to handle Thai character encoding properly
- Should log detailed error information
- Consider rate limits and retry strategies
- Verify coordinates are valid for Thailand

# Task Progress
2025-01-25_07:30:00 - IN_PROGRESS
- Identified issues in geocoding script:
  - Thai character encoding corruption
  - Insufficient error logging
  - Query construction needs optimization
  - Missing coordinate validation

2025-01-25_07:45:00 - IN_PROGRESS
- Analyzed current implementation:
  - Main service uses Mapbox for regular geocoding
  - Update scripts use Google Maps API for database updates
  - Found encoding issues in query construction
  - Identified areas for improved error handling

# Next Steps
1. Fix Thai character encoding in query strings:
   - Use proper UTF-8 encoding
   - Add input validation for Thai characters
   - Test with various Thai address formats

2. Enhance error logging:
   - Add detailed error information
   - Log API response data
   - Track retry attempts
   - Monitor rate limits

3. Optimize query construction:
   - Improve address formatting
   - Add fallback queries
   - Handle special cases (Bangkok)
   - Validate query strings

4. Add coordinate validation:
   - Check coordinates are within Thailand
   - Validate coordinate format
   - Add reasonable bounds checking
   - Log validation failures

# Important Notes
- Thai character encoding must be UTF-8
- Error logs should include API response details
- Query strings should follow Thai address conventions
- All coordinates must be within Thailand's bounds
