# Task Description
Fix the location caching system to enable display of 1,640 posts that have administrative locations but lack direct coordinates. This will improve the map's coverage by resolving coordinates for posts through their administrative location data.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses Next.js for frontend, Node.js for backend, and PostgreSQL for data storage, with specific focus on location-based data visualization and analysis.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Fix location caching to show all posts with administrative locations
- Issues identified:
  1. Cache Initialization
     - Cache not properly initialized on startup
     - Missing logging for cache state
     - No verification of cache contents
  
  2. Cache Usage
     - 1,640 posts with admin locations not showing
     - Cache lookup mechanism may need optimization
     - No error handling for cache misses
  
  3. Data Flow
     - Need to verify location data integrity
     - Ensure proper coordinate resolution
     - Implement cache warming strategy

# Steps to take
1. Verify location data integrity in database
2. Implement robust cache initialization
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Test cache with sample posts
5. Verify map display functionality

# Current execution step: 1

# Important Notes
- Previous analysis found 3,076 total unprocessed posts
- 1,436 posts have direct coordinates
- 1,640 posts need coordinates from cache
- Location hierarchy: Province -> Amphure -> Tumbon
- Cache must handle multiple administrative levels
- Need to maintain data consistency
- Performance is critical for real-time updates
