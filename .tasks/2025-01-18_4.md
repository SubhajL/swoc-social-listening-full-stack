# Task Description
Fix the UX/UI rendering of subcategories in the main page. The goal is to ensure that when the main page first loads, all subcategories for 'การรายงานและแจ้งเหตุ', 'การขอการสนับสนุน' and 'การขอข้อมูล' are properly displayed under their respective categories. The focus is purely on the display aspect, without concern for other functionalities.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses Next.js for the frontend with TypeScript, and follows a structured architecture with clear separation of concerns between components, pages, and services.

# Original Execution Protocol
```
# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Git Branch Creation
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN BRANCH]:
   ```
   git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
   ```
   git branch --show-current
   ```

## 2. Task File Creation
1. Create the [TASK FILE], naming it `[TASK_FILE_NAME]_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md` and place it in the `.tasks` directory at the root of the project.
2. The [TASK FILE] should be implemented strictly using the "Task File Template" below.
   a. Start by adding the contents of the "Task File Template" to the [TASK FILE].
   b. Adjust the values of all placeholders based on the "User Input" and placeholder terminal commands.
3. Make a visible note in the [TASK FILE] that the "Execution Protocol" and its content should NEVER be removed or edited

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for the user to confirm the name and contents of the [TASK FILE] >>>

## 3. Task Analysis
1. Examine the [TASK] by looking at related code and functionality step-by-step to get a birds eye view of everything. It is important that you do the following, in that specific order, one step at a time:
  a. Find out the core files and implementation details involved in the [TASK].
    - Store what you've found under the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
  b. Branch out
    - Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
    - Look at other files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree", by looking at even more details, be throrough and take your time.
    - Togehter with what you have previously entered under the "Task Analysis Tree" merge and add the newly gathered information.
  c. Repeat b until you have a full understanding of everything that might be involved in solving the task.
    - Do NOT stop until you can't find any more details that might be relevant to the [TASK].
2. Double check everything you've entered in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE]
  - Look through everything in the "Task Analysis Tree" and make sure you weed out everything that is not essential for solving the [TASK].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for user confirmation that your analysis is satisfactory, if not, iterate on this >>>

## **4. Iterate on the Task**
1. Analyze code context fully before changes.
2. Analyze updates under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE] to ensure you don't repeat previous mistakes or unsuccessful changes.
3. Make changes to the codebase as needed.
4. Update any progress under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE].
5. For each change:
   - Seek user confirmation on updates.
   - Mark changes as SUCCESSFUL or UNSUCCESSFUL in the log after user confirmation.
   - Optional, when apporopriate (determined appropriate by you), commit code:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user if the changes where successful or not, if not, iterate on this execution step once more >>>

## **5. Task Completion**
1. After user confirmation, and if there are changes to commit:
   - Stage all changes EXCEPT the task file:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     ```
   - Commit changes with a concise message:
     ```
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before continuing, ask the user if the [TASK BRANCH] should be merged into the [MAIN BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8 >>>

## **6. Merge Task Branch**
1. Confirm with the user before merging into [MAIN BRANCH].
2. If approved:
   - Checkout [MAIN BRANCH]:
     ```
     git checkout [MAIN BRANCH]
     ```
   - Merge:
     ```
     git merge -
     ```
3. Confirm that the merge was successful by running:
   ```
   git log [TASK BRANCH]..[MAIN BRANCH] | cat
   ```

## **7. Delete Task Branch**
1. Ask the user if we should delete the [TASK BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8
2. Delete the [TASK BRANCH]:
   ```
   git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before continuing, confirm with the user that the [TASK BRANCH] was deleted successfully by looking at `git branch --list | cat` >>>

## **8. Final Review**
1. Look at everything we've done and fill in the "Final Review" in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before we are done, give the user the final review >>>
```

NOTE: The above Execution Protocol should NEVER be removed or edited.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Improve the UX/UI of subcategory display in the main page
- Issues identified:
  - Subcategories are not properly displayed under their categories on initial page load
  - Focus categories: 'การรายงานและแจ้งเหตุ', 'การขอการสนับสนุน', 'การขอข้อมูล'
  - Current implementation may not be correctly rendering all subcategories
- Implementation goals:
  - Ensure all subcategories are visible under their respective categories
  - Maintain proper visual hierarchy and organization
  - Focus on display aspects without modifying other functionality

# Task Analysis Tree
- Frontend Application
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   └── filters/

  │   ├── pages/
  │   │   └── MainPage.tsx (Parent component managing state)
  │   └── types/
  │       └── processed-post.ts (Contains category and subcategory definitions)

# Steps to take
1. Review current implementation of FilterPanel.tsx
2. Analyze how subcategories are mapped and displayed
3. Ensure proper rendering of all subcategories under respective categories
4. Test the changes to verify correct display

# Current execution step: 4

# Important Notes
- Focus only on display/rendering aspects
- Do not modify other functionality
- Maintain existing component structure
- Ensure proper visual hierarchy
