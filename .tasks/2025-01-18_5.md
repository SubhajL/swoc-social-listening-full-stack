# Task Description
Simplify the subcategory display in the FilterPanel component by showing only one subcategory and 'ทั้งหมด' for each category. This change aims to improve visibility and user experience by reducing the initial complexity of the interface.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses Next.js for the frontend with TypeScript, and follows a structured architecture with clear separation of concerns between components, pages, and services.

# Original Execution Protocol

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Simplify subcategory display in the FilterPanel
- Issues identified:
  - Subcategories are not visible enough in the current implementation
  - Too many subcategories shown at once may overwhelm users
  - Need to ensure 'ทั้งหมด' option is clearly visible
- Implementation goals:
  - Show only one subcategory per category initially
  - Ensure 'ทั้งหมด' option is always visible
  - Maintain functionality while simplifying the UI
