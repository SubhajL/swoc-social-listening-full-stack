# Task Description
Fix test failures in the frontend application, specifically in the FilterPanel component tests and API client tests.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring and automated response generation platform for severe water-related incidents such as flooding, drought, as well as other generic questions and requests for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand. The platform uses modern tech stacks and follows conventions specified in .cursorrules.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Fix failing tests in the frontend application
- Issues identified:
  1. FilterPanel test issues:
     - Checkbox role and state not being properly tested
     - Category heading checks failing
     - Multiple elements found with same checkbox role
  2. API client test issues:
     - MSW warnings about unhandled requests
     - Endpoint mismatch for unprocessed posts
     - Connection refused errors

# Task Analysis Tree
- apps/frontend/src/components/filters/__tests__/FilterPanel.test.tsx
  - Main test file for FilterPanel component
  - Tests checkbox behavior and state management
  - Tests category and subcategory display

- apps/frontend/src/lib/__tests__/api-client.test.ts
  - Tests for API client functionality
  - Tests fetching unprocessed posts
  - Tests fetching individual posts

- apps/frontend/src/mocks/handlers.ts
  - Global MSW handlers for API mocking
  - Provides default mock responses

# Steps to take
1. Fix FilterPanel test issues
   - Update checkbox queries to use exact matches
   - Fix category heading checks
   - Improve mock implementation for Radix UI checkbox
2. Fix API client test issues
   - Set up proper MSW handlers
   - Fix endpoint mismatch
   - Handle test-specific mock overrides

# Current execution step: 2

# Important Notes
- Tests should use exact matches for checkbox queries to prevent ambiguity
- MSW handlers should be properly set up to handle all API endpoints
- Mock implementations should accurately simulate component behavior

# Task Progress
2025-01-18_00:00:00 - SUCCESSFUL
- Fixed FilterPanel test issues:
  - Updated checkbox queries to use getByLabelText with exact: true
  - Fixed category heading checks to use correct values
  - Improved Radix UI checkbox mock to handle state changes properly
  - All FilterPanel tests now passing

2025-01-18_00:00:00 - SUCCESSFUL
- Fixed API client test issues:
  - Fixed endpoint for unprocessed posts to match actual API
  - Used server.use to override global MSW handlers for specific tests
  - Imported existing MSW server instance instead of creating new one
  - All API client tests now passing

# Final Review
Task completed successfully. The following improvements were made:
1. Fixed all test failures in FilterPanel component:
   - Proper checkbox role and state testing
   - Accurate category heading checks
   - Precise element queries with exact matches
2. Fixed all test failures in API client:
   - Proper MSW handler setup
   - Correct endpoint mocking
   - Test-specific handler overrides
3. Improved test reliability:
   - No more ambiguous element queries
   - Better state management in mocks
   - More accurate API simulation

All 12 tests are now passing across all 4 test files. The test suite provides better coverage and more reliable results.
