# Task Description
Analyze and document the location data quality in processed posts, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement in map display functionality.

# Project Overview
A social monitoring platform for water-related incidents that displays posts on an interactive map. The system processes social media posts and displays them geographically to help visualize and respond to water-related issues.

# Current State Analysis

## Location Data Distribution
Total Posts Analyzed: 100
1. Posts with No Location Data (~30%):
   - General announcements
   - Social media shares
   - Relief coordination posts
   - Non-disaster related content
   - Hashtag-only posts
   - Product advertisements

2. Posts with Location Data (~70%):
   A. Mappable Posts (35-40%):
      - Have valid lat/long coordinates
      - Can be directly plotted on map
      - Mostly official reports and automated system data
   
   B. Non-Mappable Posts (30-35%):
      - Only administrative location data (province/amphure/tumbon)
      - Only street names or general area descriptions
      - No coordinates for map plotting

## Data Quality Patterns

1. Official Reports:
   - Usually have complete location data
   - Include both coordinates and administrative divisions
   - Higher accuracy in location specificity

2. Automated Systems (e.g., flood warnings):
   - Always include coordinates
   - Sometimes missing administrative divisions
   - Focus on specific infrastructure points

3. News Reports:
   - Usually include province and amphure
   - Often missing exact coordinates
   - Good coverage of administrative divisions

4. Social Media Posts:
   - Often missing precise location data
   - Usually only mention province or city names
   - Lowest location data completeness

# Issues Identified
1. Only ~35-40% of posts with location information can be displayed on map
2. Missing geocoding for administrative locations
3. Inconsistent location data format across different post sources
4. No standardized process for location data extraction from text
5. Some automated system posts lack administrative divisions

# Recommendations

## Short-term Improvements
1. Implement geocoding service to convert administrative locations to coordinates
2. Create mapping for fixed-location automated systems
3. Enhance location extraction from post text
4. Add data validation for coordinate pairs

## Long-term Solutions
1. Develop machine learning model for location entity extraction
2. Create location database mapping common landmarks and areas
3. Implement fuzzy matching for location names
4. Add user-assisted location verification system

## Technical Implementation Plan
1. Geocoding Integration:
   - Add geocoding service (e.g., Mapbox, Google)
   - Create location cache to minimize API calls
   - Implement batch geocoding for historical data

2. Data Processing Enhancement:
   - Add location entity extraction
   - Implement coordinate validation
   - Create location normalization pipeline

3. Database Updates:
   - Add location verification status
   - Create location reference tables
   - Add indices for spatial queries

4. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add location verification interface
   - Implement location search/filter
   - Add location clustering for dense areas

# Success Metrics
1. Increase percentage of mappable posts to >70%
2. Reduce invalid/inaccurate coordinates to <1%
3. Achieve 95% accuracy in administrative location extraction
4. Maintain geocoding service response time <500ms

# Next Steps
1. Select and integrate geocoding service
2. Create location validation pipeline
3. Update database schema
4. Implement location extraction improvements
5. Add monitoring for location data quality
